# Sprint 3

### Deadline

-  ~~2023-12-03~~ 2023-12-10 at 23:59

### Overview:

Sprint 3 is a significant step forward in our projects' development.  Here's what you can expect:

1. By the end of this sprint, you should be able to connect your front-end React app to the back-end API. Up until now, we've been working on both the front-end (what users see and interact with) and the back-end (the server and database that power our applications) separately. In Sprint 3, we will focus on integrating these two components seamlessly. This integration is essential to ensure that data flows smoothly between the user interface and the server, providing a seamless user experience.

2. User Authentication and Authorization: One of the core features we'll be adding in Sprint 3 is user authentication and authorization. This means that we will enable users to create accounts, log in, and access certain parts of our projects based on their roles and permissions. 


### Key Tasks for Sprint 3:

- Design and implement user registration and login functionality.
- Develop role-based access control to determine what users can and cannot do within the application.
- Ensure that data flows smoothly between the front-end and back-end components.
 
### Expectations:

- Collaboration and communication within your project teams are crucial. Ensure that all team members are on the same page and contributing effectively.
- Be prepared to troubleshoot and solve technical challenges as they arise. Problem-solving is a key skill in web development.
