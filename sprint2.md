# Sprint 2 - Front-End/Back-End Integration

**Deadline**

- 2023-11-19 at 23:59

### Overview

In Sprint 2, our focus will be divided into two weeks. Here are the detailed instructions for each week:

## Week 3:
------

**Front-End:**

- **Step 1:** Design and create the HTML and CSS for all pages of your application, including any necessary forms. We recommend using flexbox for layout, but if you are comfortable with CSS grid, you can use that as well. Ensure that your pages are responsive, providing a great user experience on different devices. You can refer to these links  for guidance:
- Flexbox: [Link1](https://internetingishard.netlify.app/html-and-css/flexbox/), [Link2](https://youtu.be/3YW65K6LcIA)
- [Responsive design](https://internetingishard.netlify.app/html-and-css/responsive-design/)

- **Step 2:** Use the "html2jsx" tool to convert the HTML pages you've created into JSX. You can access this tool at [htmltojsx.com](https://htmltojsx.com/). This step will help you transition your front-end from HTML to React JSX.

- **Step 3:** Create static components in React using the JSX from Step 2. These components will serve as the building blocks for your dynamic front-end.

## Back-End:

- **Step 1:** Develop the mock data, controllers, routers, and middleware necessary for your application. This involves setting up the structure of your back-end and setting up routes to handle different API endpoints. To generate mock data, you can use this [tool](https://www.mockaroo.com/).

- **Step 2:** Test all API endpoints using Postman. Ensure that you create collections in Postman to organize and test your API routes. This step is crucial to validate the functionality and correctness of your back-end operations.

## Week 4:
------

**Front-End:**

- In the front end during week 4, focus on adding routing capabilities to your application. Create routes for different views or pages of your application.  

**Back-End:**

- In the back end during week 4, the primary focus will be on enhancing the data model to incorporate data persistence using MongoDB and Mongoose. This transition will allow your application to store and manage data more effectively. As part of this process, you will also need to refactor the controllers to work with the new data model.

- Additionally, you will receive baseline code for both the back end and front end. While you may not need this code entirely, it can serve as a reference or starting point for your development work.

### Overview

This part focuses on enhancing the user interface (UI) and integrating both the front-end and back-end components of your projects. These skills are crucial for developing a fully functional web application.

### Sprint Objectives

By the end of this sprint, you should be able to connect your front-end React app to the back-end API. 
This integration is essential to ensure that data flows smoothly between the user interface and the server, providing a seamless user experience.

### Key Tasks for Sprint 2:

**Baseline Code:** You will receive baseline code for both the Backend and Front End. While starting from scratch is an option, using the provided code is recommended for efficiency.

**Study the Code:** Take the time to understand the logic behind the provided code. This will save you from reinventing the wheel and ensure you're building on a solid foundation.

**CSS Refresher:** CSS plays a pivotal role in web development. As part of this sprint, we'll focus on refreshing our CSS skills, particularly the use of the flexbox layout. Flexbox is a powerful tool for creating responsive and flexible layouts. I  recommend watching this [Flexbox Crash Course](https://youtu.be/3YW65K6LcIA) to strengthen your CSS skills.

**Expectations:** This sprint is a significant step in your project's development. Collaboration within your groups is essential. Ensure that your UI is not only visually appealing but also user-friendly. The successful integration of front-end and back-end components is critical for a functional application.
